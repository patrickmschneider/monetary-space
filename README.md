# monetary-space

A single-screen UK monetary policy dashboard: is policy tight enough for the inflation pressure?

A Python script fetches the data, scores it and renders one static HTML page. GitHub Actions rebuilds the page on a schedule and GitHub Pages hosts it. The full build spec is in [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md).

**Status:** Phase 1 of 4. Blocks A (demand) and B (domestic inflation) are scored on a plain page. The global block, policy stance, verdict and final layout come in later phases.

## Run it locally

```sh
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest -q
python -m monetary_space build          # fetch, store a vintage, score, render to site/
python -m monetary_space build --no-fetch   # rebuild from the latest stored vintage
open site/index.html
```

Local runs store vintages in `store/` (ignored by git). Put `FRED_API_KEY=...` in a `.env` file for sources that need it (from Phase 2).

## How it fits together

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `config/indicators.yaml` | Every series and scored indicator: source, code, transform, benchmark, σ, sign, lag, attribution |
| `config/weights.yaml` | Pressure weights, thresholds, z clip, r\* range, rule coefficients |
| `manual/` | Hand-maintained CSVs: MPR projections and u\*, MPC dates and votes, r\* estimates, fiscal events |
| `src/monetary_space/fetch/` | One module per publisher (ONS, Bank of England) |
| `src/monetary_space/transform.py`, `score.py` | Pure functions for transforms, benchmarks and the scoring rules |
| `src/monetary_space/store.py` | Dated vintages, one Parquet file per build day, on the `data` branch |
| `src/monetary_space/render.py` | The static page |
| `scripts/gate.py` | Lets the right UTC cron run through for 07:10 and 12:15 UK time |

Changing a benchmark, weight or threshold in `config/` changes the page with no code edits.

## Scheduled builds

`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs at 07:10 UK time every day (after the 07:00 ONS releases) and at 12:15 UK on MPC announcement days listed in `manual/mpc_dates.csv`. It also runs on every push to `main` and from **Actions → build → Run workflow**. Each run saves the day's raw data to the `data` branch, then deploys the page.

- **Late starts.** GitHub can start scheduled runs late when busy. On release days, use the manual trigger.
- **Failed sources.** If a source fails, the last good value is kept, marked on the page, and logged in `fetch_log.csv` on the `data` branch. The page still builds. GitHub emails the repository owner if a whole run fails.
- **Schedules switched off.** GitHub disables scheduled workflows in public repositories after 60 days without activity. To re-enable: **Actions → build → Enable workflow**. Whether the daily data commits count as activity is still to be confirmed.
- **Secret.** `FRED_API_KEY` is a repository secret (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions).
